# A Concensus Gene Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas
##### In partnership with ALMAC

This project was an analysis of transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The objective of the project was to try identify a pan solid cancer molecular signal that charaterises the cancer hallmark of inavasion and metasteses. This involved unsupervised and non-hypothesis driven approaches to create a heatmap with heirarchecal clustering and xgboost gene signature development.
